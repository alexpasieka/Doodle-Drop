Doodle Drop

Doodle Drop is a web application for posting and sharing hand-drawn doodles.
Users can create an account, post doodles, view all their doodles on their account page,
and change their password if they want.
Also, regardless of if a user has an account, everyone can view the home page,
which features all doodles posted by all accounts.

In terms of a profit model, as shown by the first post on the home page,
advertisements could be placed where posts would normally be.

I used Handlebars for a templating language. It is mostly used for populating both
the home page and a user's account page with respective doodles.

I built this app using the MVC architecture by writing controllers that grabbed data
from the needed models stored within mongoDB using mongoose and passing that data into
views defined in a separate folder.

Specifically, mongoDB stored not only all of the doodles (including each doodle's information),
but also all of the users' account data (including username and password).

For above and beyond, I did mix in a bit of React for a few dynamic pages, mainly on the login/signup
page and the upload page. For some help with styling, I utilized Bootstrap.

By the end, I was running out of time, so there are parts of my code that are not as organized and
commented as other parts. I hope I made up for that with the actual look and functionality of the
application.
